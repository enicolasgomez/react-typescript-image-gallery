# Responsive image gallery with React

This project is an example of how you can create a responsive image gallery with React

## Requirements

NodeJS v12 and npm

## Setting up the project locally

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this project.
2. In the project directory on your local machine, run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
3. Use the `npm run build` to build it
4. After that, use `npm run start` to start the development server and open the browser with the project.

## Pendings

1. Shows author name, camera model and hashtags as an overlay.
2. Allows sharing a photo URL via a floating action button.
3. Support zooming and panning for images.
4. Modal? In general I'd rather say away from them when looking for responsiveness
